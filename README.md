# FORCE: Factorized Observables for Regressing Conditional Expectation

This repository contains the code presented in the paper **Anomaly Detection in Collider Physics via Factorized Observables**.
The data and results are stored in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rtbj10e7nvokqjj0d2i0v/h?rlkey=phk4cg4zt1c5y4p0927rn5p2c&dl=0) due to their size.

## Python
This directory contains notebooks and helper functions for the analyses presented in the paper. Most notably, ```FORCE.ipynb``` contains an example for data loading, model creation, and model application, as well as a signal sensitivity sweep.
